Chaser John Collier Alan Austen, as nervous as a kitten, went up certain dark and creaky stairs in the neighborhood of Pell Street, and peered about for a long time on the dim landing before he found the name he wanted written obscurely on one of the doors. He pushed open this door, as he had been told to do, and found himself in a tiny room, which contained no furniture but a plain kitchen table, a rocking-chair, and an ordinary chair. On one of the dirty buff-colored walls were a couple of shelves, containing in all perhaps a dozen bottles and jars. An old man sat in the rocking-chair, reading a newspaper. Alan, without a word, handed him the card he had been given. \u201cSit down, Mr. Austen,\u201d said the old man very politely. \u201cI am glad to make your acquaintance.\u201d \u201cIs it true,\u201d asked Alan, \u201cthat you have a certain mixture that has\u2014er\u2014quite extraordinary effects?\u201d \u201cMy dear sir,\u201d replied the old man, \u201cmy stock in trade is not very large\u2014I don\u2019t deal in laxatives and teething mixtures\u2014but such as it is, it is varied. I think nothing I sell has effects which could be precisely described as ordinary.\u201d \u201cWell, the fact is\u2014\u201d began Alan. \u201cHere, for example,\u201d interrupted the old man, reaching for a bottle from the shelf. \u201cHere is a liquid as colorless as water, almost tasteless, quite imperceptible in coffee, wine, or any other beverage. It is also quite imperceptible to any known method of autopsy.\u201d \u201cDo you mean it is a poison?\u201d cried Alan, very much horrified. \u201cCall it a glove-cleaner if you like,\u201d said the old man indifferently. \u201cMaybe it will clean gloves. I have never tried. One might call it a life-cleaner. Lives need cleaning sometimes.\u201d \u201cI want nothing of that sort,\u201d said Alan. \u201cProbably it is just as well,\u201d said the old man. \u201cDo you know the price of this? For one teaspoonful, which is sufficient, I ask five thousand dollars. Never less. Not a penny less.\u201d \u201cI hope all your mixtures are not as expensive,\u201d said Alan apprehensively. \u201cOh dear, no,\u201d said the old man. \u201cIt would be no good charging that sort of price for a love potion, for example. Young people who need a love potion very seldom have five thousand dollars. Otherwise they would not need a love potion.\u201d \u201cI am glad to hear that,\u201d said Alan. \u201cI look at it like this,\u201d said the old man. \u201cPlease a customer with one article, and he will come back when he needs another. Even if it is more costly. He will save up for it, if necessary.\u201d \u201cSo,\u201d said Alan, \u201cyou really do sell love potions?\u201d \u201cIf I did not sell love potions,\u201d said the old man, reaching for another bottle, \u201cI should not have mentioned the other matter to you. It is only when one is in a position to oblige that one can afford to be so confidential.\u201d \u201cAnd these potions,\u201d said Alan. \u201cThey are not just\u2014just\u2014er\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d said the old man. \u201cTheir effects are permanent, and extend far beyond casual impulse. But they include it. Bountifully, insistently. Everlastingly.\u201d \u201cDear me!\u201d said Alan, attempting a look of scientific detachment. \"How very interesting!\u201d \u201cBut consider the spiritual side,\u201d said the old man. \u201cI do, indeed,\u201d said Alan. \u201cFor indifference,\u201d said the old man, \u201cthey substitute devotion. For scorn, adoration. Give one tiny measure of this to the young lady\u2014its flavor is imperceptible in orange juice, soup, or cocktails\u2014and however gay and giddy she is, she will change altogether. She will want nothing but solitude, and you.\u201d \u201cI can hardly believe it,\u201d said Alan. \u201cShe is so fond of parties.\u201d \u201cShe will not like them any more,\u201d said the old man. \u201cShe will be afraid of the pretty girls you may meet.\u201d \u201cShe will actually be jealous?\u201d cried Alan in a rapture. \u201cOf me?\u201d \u201cYes, she will want to be everything to you.\u201d \u201cShe is, already. Only she doesn\u2019t care about it.\u201d \u201cShe will, when she has taken this. She will care intensely. You will be her sole interest in life.\u201d \u201cWonderful!\u201d cried Alan. \u201cShe will want to know all you do,\u201d said the old man. \u201cAll that has happened to you during the day. Every word of it. She will want to know what you are thinking about, why you smile suddenly, why you are looking sad.\u201d \u201cThat is love!\u201d cried Alan. \u201cYes,\u201d said the old man. \u201cHow carefully she will look after you! She will never allow you to be tired, to sit in a draught, to neglect your food. If you are an hour late, she will be terrified. She will think you are killed, or that some siren has caught you.\u201d \u201cI can hardly imagine Diana like that!\u201d cried Alan, overwhelmed with joy. \u201cYou will not have to use your imagination,\u201d said the old man. \u201cAnd, by the way, since there are always sirens, if by any chance you should, later on, slip a little, you need not worry. She will forgive you, in the end. She will be terribly hurt, of course, but she will forgive you\u2014in the end.\u201d \u201cThat will not happen,\u201d said Alan fervently. \u201cOf course not,\u201d said the old man. \u201cBut, if it did, you need not worry. She would never divorce you. Oh, no! And, of course, she herself will never give you the least, the very least, grounds for\u2014uneasiness.\u201d \u201cAnd how much,\u201d said Alan, \u201cis this wonderful mixture?\u201d \u201cIt is not as dear,\u201d said the old man, \u201cas the glove-cleaner, or life-cleaner, as I sometimes call it. No. That is five thousand dollars, never a penny less. One has to be older than you are, to indulge in that sort of thing. One has to save up for it.\u201d \u201cBut the love potion?\u201d said Alan. \u201cOh, that,\u201d said the old man, opening the drawer in the kitchen table, and taking out a tiny, rather dirty-looking phial. \u201cThat is just a dollar.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how grateful I am,\u201d said Alan, watching him fill it. \u201cI like to oblige,\u201d said the old man. \u201cThen customers come back, later in life, when they are better off, and want more expensive things. Here you are. You will find it very effective.\u201d \u201cThank you again,\u201d said Alan. \u201cGood-bye.\u201d \u201cAu revoir,\u201d said the man.

Some of them, as far as I can remember, were quite nice.\" Framton wondered whether Mrs. Sappleton, the lady to whom he was presenting one of the letters of introduction came into the nice division. \"Do you know many of the people round here?\" asked the niece, when she judged that they had had sufficient silent communion. \"Hardly a soul,\" said Framton. \"My sister was staying here, at the rectory, you know, some four years ago, and she gave me letters of introduction to some of the people here.\" He made the last statement in a tone of distinct regret. \"Then you know practically nothing about my aunt?\" pursued the self-possessed young lady. \"Only her name and address,\" admitted the caller. He was wondering whether Mrs. Sappleton was in the married or widowed state. An undefinable something about the room seemed to suggest masculine habitation. \"Her great tragedy happened just three years ago,\" said the child; \"that would be since your sister's time.\" \"Her tragedy?\" asked Framton; somehow in this restful country spot tragedies seemed out of place. \"You may wonder why we keep that window wide open on an October afternoon,\" said the niece, indicating a large French window that opened on to a lawn. \"It is quite warm for the time of the year,\" said Framton; \"but has that window got anything to do with the tragedy?\" \"Out through that window, three years ago to a day, her husband and her two young brothers went off for their day's shooting. They never came back. In crossing the moor to their favorite snipe-shooting ground they were all three engulfed in a treacherous piece of bog. It had been that dreadful wet summer, you know, and places that were safe in other years gave way suddenly without warning. Their bodies were never recovered. That was the dreadful part of it.\" Here the child's voice lost its self-possessed note and became falteringly human. \"Poor aunt always thinks that they will come back someday, they and the little brown spaniel that was lost with them, and walk in at that window just as they used to do. That is why the window is kept open every evening till it is quite dusk. Poor dear aunt, she has often told me how they went out, her husband with his white waterproof coat over his arm, and Ronnie, her youngest brother, singing 'Bertie, why do you bound?' as he always did to tease her, because she said it got on her nerves. Do you know, sometimes on still, quiet evenings like this, I almost get a creepy feeling that they will all walk in through that window--\" She broke off with a little shudder. It was a relief to Framton when the aunt bustled into the room with a whirl of apologies for being late in making her appearance. \"I hope Vera has been amusing you?\" she said. \"She has been very interesting,\" said Framton. \"I hope you don't mind the open window,\" said Mrs. Sappleton briskly; \"my husband and brothers will be home directly from shooting, and they always come in this way.

It was certainly an unfortunate coincidence that he should have paid his visit on this tragic anniversary. \"The doctors agree in ordering me complete rest, an absence of mental excitement, and avoidance of anything in the nature of violent physical exercise,\" announced Framton, who labored under the tolerably widespread delusion that total strangers and chance acquaintances are hungry for the least detail of one's ailments and infirmities, their cause and cure. \"On the matter of diet they are not so much in agreement,\" he continued. \"No?\" said Mrs. Sappleton, in a voice which only replaced a yawn at the last moment. Then she suddenly brightened into alert attention--but not to what Framton was saying. \"Here they are at last!\" she cried. \"Just in time for tea, and don't they look as if they were muddy up to the eyes!\" Framton shivered slightly and turned towards the niece with a look intended to convey sympathetic comprehension. The child was staring out through the open window with a dazed horror in her eyes. In a chill shock of nameless fear Framton swung round in his seat and looked in the same direction. In the deepening twilight three figures were walking across the lawn towards the window, they all carried guns under their arms, and one of them was additionally burdened with a white coat hung over his shoulders. A tired brown spaniel kept close at their heels. Noiselessly they neared the house, and then a hoarse young voice chanted out of the dusk: \"I said, Bertie, why do you bound?\" Framton grabbed wildly at his stick and hat; the hall door, the gravel drive, and the front gate were dimly noted stages in his headlong retreat. A cyclist coming along the road had to run into the hedge to avoid imminent collision. \"Here we are, my dear,\" said the bearer of the white mackintosh, coming in through the window, \"fairly muddy, but most of it's dry.

He had no fear of trouble, for he was a warden \u2013 the name that the proprietor and headmaster of a rather expensive preparatory school had chosen to give to approved, reliable boys in the lower forms (from a warden one became a guardian and finally before leaving, it was hoped for Marlborough or Rugby, a crusader). The housemaster, Mr. Wordsworth, sat behind his desk with an appearance of perplexity and apprehension. Jerome had the odd impression when he entered that he was a cause of fear. \u201cSit down, Jerome,\u201d Mr. Wordsworth said. \u201cAll going well with the trigonometry?\u201d \u201cYes, sir.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve had a telephone call, Jerome. From your aunt. I\u2019m afraid I have bad news for you.\u201d \u201cYes, sir?\u201d \u201cYour father has had an accident.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Mr. Wordsworth looked at him with some surprise. \u201cA serious accident.\u201d \u201cYes, sir?\u201d Jerome worshipped his father: the verb is exact. As man recreates God, so Jerome recreated his father \u2013 from a restless widowed author into a mysterious adventurer who traveled in far places \u2013 Nice, Beirut, Majorca, even the Canaries. The time had arrived about his eighth birthday when Jerome believed that his father either \u201cran guns\u201d or was a member of the British Secret Service. Now it occurred to him that his father might have been wounded in \u201ca hail of machine-gun bullets\u201d. Mr. Wordsworth played with the ruler on his desk. He seemed at a loss how to continue. He said, \u201cYou know your father was in Naples?\u201d \u201cYes, sir.\u201d \u201cYour aunt heard from the hospital today.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Mr. Wordsworth said with desperation, \u201cIt was a street accident.\u201d \u201cYes, sir?\u201d It seemed quite likely to Jerome that they would call it a street accident. The police of course had fired first; his father would not take human life except as a last resort. \u201cI\u2019m afraid your father was very seriously hurt indeed.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d \u201cIn fact, Jerome, he died yesterday. Quite without pain.\u201d \u201cDid they shoot him through the heart?\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon. What did you say, Jerome?\u201d \u201cDid they shoot him through the heart?\u201d \u201cNobody shot him, Jerome. A pig fell on him.\u201d An inexplicable convulsion took place in the nerves of Mr. Wordsworth\u2019s face; it really looked for a moment as though he were going to laugh. He closed his eyes, composed his features and said rapidly as though it were necessary to expel the story as rapidly as possible. \u201cYour father was walking along a street in Naples when a pig fell on him. A shocking accident. Apparently in the poorer quarters of Naples they keep pigs on their balconies. This one was on the fifth floor. It had grown too fat. The balcony broke. The pig fell on your father.\u201d Mr. Wordsworth left his desk rapidly and went to the window, turning his back on Jerome. He shook a little with emotion. Jerome said, \u201cWhat happened to the pig?\u201d 2 This was not callousness on the part of Jerome, as it was interpreted by Mr. Wordsworth to his colleagues (he even discussed with them whether, perhaps, Jerome was yet fitted to be a warden). Jerome was only attempting to visualize the strange scene to get the details right. Nor was Jerome a boy who cried; he was a boy who brooded, and it never occurred to him at his preparatory school that the circumstances of his father\u2019s death were comic \u2013 they were still part of the mysteries of life. It was later, in his first term at his public school, when he told the story to his best friend, that he began to realize how it affected others. Naturally after that disclosure he was known, rather unreasonably, as Pig. Unfortunately his aunt had no sense of humor. There was an enlarged snapshot of his father on the piano; a large sad man in an unsuitable dark suit posed in Capri with an umbrella (to guard him against sunstroke), the Faraglione rocks forming the background. By the age of sixteen Jerome was well aware that the portrait looked more like the author of Sunshine and Shade and Ramblers in the Balearics than an agent of the Secret Service. All the same he loved the memory of his father: he still possessed an album filled with picture postcards (the stamps had been soaked off long ago for his other collection), and it pained him when his aunt embarked with strangers on the story of his father\u2019s death. \u201cA shocking accident,\u201d she would begin, and the stranger would compose his or her features into the correct shape for interest and commiseration. Both reactions, of course, were false, but it was terrible for Jerome to see how suddenly, midway in her rambling discourse, the interest would become genuine. \u201cI can\u2019t think how such things can be allowed in a civilized country,\u201d his aunt would say. \u201cI suppose one has to regard Italy as civilized. One is prepared for all kinds of things abroad, of course, and my brother was a great traveler. He always carried a water-filter with him. It was far less expensive, you know, than buying all those bottles of mineral water. My brother always said that his filter paid for his dinner wine. You can see from that what a careful man he was, but who could possibly have expected when he was walking along the Via Dottore Manuele Panucci on his way to the Hydrographic Museum that a pig would fall on him?\u201d That was the moment when the interest became genuine. It seemed to Jerome that there were two possible methods of recounting his father\u2019s death\u2014the first led gently up to the accident, so that by the time it was described the listener was so well prepared that the death came really as an anti-climax. The chief danger of laughter in such a story was always surprise. When he rehearsed his method Jerome began boringly enough. \u201cYou know Naples and those high tenement buildings? Somebody once told me that the Neapolitan always feels at home in New York just as the man from Turin feels at home in London because the river runs in much the same way in both cities. Where was I? Oh, yes. Naples, of course. You\u2019d be surprised in the poorer quarters what things they keep on the balconies of those sky-scraping tenements -- not washing, you know, or bedding, but things like livestock, chickens or even pigs. Of course the pigs get no exercise whatever and fatten all the quicker.\u201d He could imagine how his hearer\u2019s eyes would have glazed by this time. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea, have you, how heavy a pig can be, but these old buildings are all badly in need of repair. A balcony on the fifth floor gave way under one of those pigs. It struck the third floor balcony on its way down and sort of ricocheted into the street. My father was on the way to the Hydrographic Museum when the pig hit him. Coming from that height and that angle it broke his neck.\u201d This was really a masterly attempt to make an intrinsically interesting subject boring. The other method Jerome rehearsed had the virtue of brevity. \u201cMy father was killed by a pig.\u201d \u201cReally? In India?\u201d \u201cNo, in Italy.\u201d \u201cHow interesting. I never realized there was pig-sticking in Italy. Was your father keen on polo?\u201d In course of time, neither too early nor too late, rather as though, in his capacity as a chartered accountant, Jerome had studied the statistics and taken the average, he became engaged to be married: to a pleasant fresh-faced girl of twenty-five whose father was a doctor in Pinner. Her name was Sally, her favorite author was still Hugh Walpole, and she had adored babies ever since she had been given a doll at the age of five which moved its eyes and made water. Their relationship was contented rather than exciting, as became the love-affair of a chartered accountant; it would never have done if it had interfered with the figures. One thought worried Jerome, however. Now that within a year he might himself become a father, his love for the dead man increased; he realized what affection had gone into the picture-postcards. He felt a longing to protect his memory, and uncertain whether this quiet love of his would survive if Sally were so insensitive as to laugh when she heard the story of his father\u2019s death. Inevitably she would hear it when Jerome brought her to dinner with his aunt. Several times he tried to tell her himself, as she was naturally anxious to know all she could that concerned him. \u201cYou were very small when your father died?\u201d \u201cJust nine.\u201d \u201cPoor little boy,\u201d she said. \u201cI was at school. They broke the news to me.\u201d \u201cDid you take it very hard?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d \u201cYou never told me how it happened.\u201d \u201cIt was very sudden. A street accident.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll never drive fast, will you, Jenny?\u201d (She had begun to call him \u201cJenny\u201d.) It was too late then to try the second method \u2013 the one he thought of as the pig-sticking one. They were going to marry quietly in a registry-office and have their honeymoon at Torquay. He avoided taking her to see his aunt until a week before the wedding, but then the night came, and he could not have told himself whether his apprehension was more for his father\u2019s memory or the security of his own love. The moment came all too soon. \u201cIs that Jenny\u2019s father?\u201d Sally asked, picking up the portrait of the man with the umbrella. \u201cYes, dear. How did you guess?\u201d \u201cHe has Jenny\u2019s eyes and brow, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cHas Jerome lent you his books?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI will give you a set for your wedding. He wrote so tenderly about his travels. My own favorite is Nooks and Crannies . He would have had a great future. It made that shocking accident all the worse.\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d Jerome longed to leave the room and not see that loved face crinkle with irresistible amusement. \u201cI had so many letters from his readers after the pig fell on him.\u201d She had never been so abrupt before. And then the miracle happened. Sally did not laugh. Sally sat with open eyes of horror while his aunt told her the story, and at the end, \u201cHow horrible,\u201d Sally said. \u201cIt makes you think, doesn\u2019t it? Happening like that. Out of a clear sky.\u201d Jerome\u2019s heart sang with joy. It was as though she had appeased his fear forever. In the taxi going home he kissed her with more passion than he had ever shown and she returned it. There were babies in her pale blue pupils, babies that rolled their eyes and made water. \u201cA week today,\u201d Jerome said, and she squeezed his hand. \u201cPenny for your thoughts, my darling.\u201d \u201cI was wondering,\u201d Sally said, \u201cwhat happened to the poor pig?\u201d \u201cThey almost certainly had it for dinner,\u201d Jerome said happily and kissed the dear child again.

All the same he loved the memory of his father: he still possessed an album filled with picture postcards (the stamps had been soaked off long ago for his other collection), and it pained him when his aunt embarked with strangers on the story of his father\u2019s death. \u201cA shocking accident,\u201d she would begin, and the stranger would compose his or her features into the correct shape for interest and commiseration. Both reactions, of course, were false, but it was terrible for Jerome to see how suddenly, midway in her rambling discourse, the interest would become genuine. \u201cI can\u2019t think how such things can be allowed in a civilized country,\u201d his aunt would say. \u201cI suppose one has to regard Italy as civilized. One is prepared for all kinds of things abroad, of course, and my brother was a great traveler. He always carried a water-filter with him. It was far less expensive, you know, than buying all those bottles of mineral water. My brother always said that his filter paid for his dinner wine. You can see from that what a careful man he was, but who could possibly have expected when he was walking along the Via Dottore Manuele Panucci on his way to the Hydrographic Museum that a pig would fall on him?\u201d That was the moment when the interest became genuine. It seemed to Jerome that there were two possible methods of recounting his father\u2019s death\u2014the first led gently up to the accident, so that by the time it was described the listener was so well prepared that the death came really as an anti-climax. The chief danger of laughter in such a story was always surprise. When he rehearsed his method Jerome began boringly enough. \u201cYou know Naples and those high tenement buildings? Somebody once told me that the Neapolitan always feels at home in New York just as the man from Turin feels at home in London because the river runs in much the same way in both cities. Where was I? Oh, yes. Naples, of course. You\u2019d be surprised in the poorer quarters what things they keep on the balconies of those sky-scraping tenements -- not washing, you know, or bedding, but things like livestock, chickens or even pigs. Of course the pigs get no exercise whatever and fatten all the quicker.\u201d He could imagine how his hearer\u2019s eyes would have glazed by this time. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea, have you, how heavy a pig can be, but these old buildings are all badly in need of repair. A balcony on the fifth floor gave way under one of those pigs. It struck the third floor balcony on its way down and sort of ricocheted into the street. My father was on the way to the Hydrographic Museum when the pig hit him. Coming from that height and that angle it broke his neck.\u201d This was really a masterly attempt to make an intrinsically interesting subject boring. The other method Jerome rehearsed had the virtue of brevity. \u201cMy father was killed by a pig.\u201d \u201cReally? In India?\u201d \u201cNo, in Italy.\u201d \u201cHow interesting. I never realized there was pig-sticking in Italy. Was your father keen on polo?\u201d In course of time, neither too early nor too late, rather as though, in his capacity as a chartered accountant, Jerome had studied the statistics and taken the average, he became engaged to be married: to a pleasant fresh-faced girl of twenty-five whose father was a doctor in Pinner. Her name was Sally, her favorite author was still Hugh Walpole, and she had adored babies ever since she had been given a doll at the age of five which moved its eyes and made water. Their relationship was contented rather than exciting, as became the love-affair of a chartered accountant; it would never have done if it had interfered with the figures. One thought worried Jerome, however. Now that within a year he might himself become a father, his love for the dead man increased; he realized what affection had gone into the picture-postcards. He felt a longing to protect his memory, and uncertain whether this quiet love of his would survive if Sally were so insensitive as to laugh when she heard the story of his father\u2019s death. Inevitably she would hear it when Jerome brought her to dinner with his aunt. Several times he tried to tell her himself, as she was naturally anxious to know all she could that concerned him. \u201cYou were very small when your father died?\u201d \u201cJust nine.\u201d \u201cPoor little boy,\u201d she said. \u201cI was at school. They broke the news to me.\u201d \u201cDid you take it very hard?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d \u201cYou never told me how it happened.\u201d \u201cIt was very sudden. A street accident.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll never drive fast, will you, Jenny?\u201d (She had begun to call him \u201cJenny\u201d.) It was too late then to try the second method \u2013 the one he thought of as the pig-sticking one. They were going to marry quietly in a registry-office and have their honeymoon at Torquay. He avoided taking her to see his aunt until a week before the wedding, but then the night came, and he could not have told himself whether his apprehension was more for his father\u2019s memory or the security of his own love. The moment came all too soon. \u201cIs that Jenny\u2019s father?\u201d Sally asked, picking up the portrait of the man with the umbrella. \u201cYes, dear. How did you guess?\u201d \u201cHe has Jenny\u2019s eyes and brow, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cHas Jerome lent you his books?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI will give you a set for your wedding. He wrote so tenderly about his travels. My own favorite is Nooks and Crannies . He would have had a great future. It made that shocking accident all the worse.\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d Jerome longed to leave the room and not see that loved face crinkle with irresistible amusement. \u201cI had so many letters from his readers after the pig fell on him.\u201d She had never been so abrupt before. And then the miracle happened. Sally did not laugh. Sally sat with open eyes of horror while his aunt told her the story, and at the end, \u201cHow horrible,\u201d Sally said. \u201cIt makes you think, doesn\u2019t it? Happening like that. Out of a clear sky.\u201d Jerome\u2019s heart sang with joy. It was as though she had appeased his fear forever. In the taxi going home he kissed her with more passion than he had ever shown and she returned it. There were babies in her pale blue pupils, babies that rolled their eyes and made water. \u201cA week today,\u201d Jerome said, and she squeezed his hand. \u201cPenny for your thoughts, my darling.\u201d \u201cI was wondering,\u201d Sally said, \u201cwhat happened to the poor pig?\u201d \u201cThey almost certainly had it for dinner,\u201d Jerome said happily and kissed the dear child again.","title":"A Shocking Accident"},{"location":"course/week4/#preparation-questions","text":"How old is Jerome at the beginning of the story?

It was long since I had last seen her and if someone had not mentioned her name I do not think I would have recognized her. She addressed me brightly. \"Well, it's many years since we first met. How time does fly! We are not getting any younger. Do you remember the first time I saw you? You asked me to luncheon.\" Did I remember? It was twenty years ago and I was living in Paris. I had a tiny apartment in the Latin Quarter overlooking a cemetery, and I was earning barely enough money to keep body and soul together. She had read a book of mine and had written to me about it. I answered, thanking her, and presently I received from her another letter saying that she was passing through Paris and would like to have a chat with me; but her time was limited, and the only free moment she had was on the following Thursday; she was spending the morning at the Luxembourg and would I give her a little luncheon at Foyot's afterwards? Foyot's is a restaurant at which the French senators eat, and it was so far beyond my means that I had never even thought of going there. But I was flattered, and I was too young to have leaned to say no to a woman. (Few men, I may add, learn this until they are too old to make it of any consequence to a woman what they say.) I had eighty francs (gold francs) to last me the rest of the month, and a modest luncheon should not cost more than fifteen. If I cut out coffee for the next two weeks I could manage well enough. I answered that I would meet my friend\u2014by correspondence\u2014 at Foyot's on Thursday at half past twelve. She was not so young as I expected and in appearance imposing rather than attractive. She was, in fact, a woman of forty (a charming age, but not one that excites a sudden and devastating passion at first sight), and she gave me the impression of having more teeth, white and large and even, than were necessary for any practical purpose. She was talkative, but since she seemed inclined to talk about me I was prepared to be an attentive listener. I was startled when the bill of fare was brought, for the prices were a great deal higher than I had anticipated. But she reassured me. \u201cI never eat anything for luncheon,\" she said. \"Oh, don't say that!\" I answered generously. \"I never eat more than one thing. I think people eat far too much nowadays. A little fish, perhaps. I wonder if they have any salmon.\" Well, it was early in the year for salmon and it was not on the bill of fare, but I asked the waiter if there was any. Yes, a beautiful salmon had just come in, it was the first they had had. I ordered it for my guest. The waiter asked her if she would have something while it was being cooked. \"No,\" she answered, \"I never eat more than one thing. Unless you had a little caviare. I never mind caviare.\" My heart sank a little. I knew I could not afford caviare, but I could not very well tell her that. I told the waiter by all means to bring caviare. For myself I chose the cheapest dish on the menu and that was a mutton chop. \"I think you're unwise to eat meat,\" she said. \"I don't know how you can expect to work after eating heavy things like chops. I don\u2019t believe in overloading my stomach.\" Then came the question of drink. \"I never drink anything for luncheon,\" she said. \"Neither do I,\" I answered promptly. \"Except white wine,\" she proceeded as though I had not spoken. \"These French white wines are so light. They are wonderful for the digestion.\" \"What would you like?\" I asked her, hospitable still, but not exactly effusive. She gave me a bright and amicable flash of her white teeth. \"My doctor won't let me drink anything but champagne.\" I fancy I turned a trifle pale. I ordered half a bottle. I mentioned casually that my doctor had absolutely forbidden me to drink champagne. \"What are you going to drink, then?\" \"Water.\" She ate the caviare and she ate the salmon. She talked gaily of art and literature and music. But I wondered what the bill would come to. When my mutton chop arrived she took me quite seriously to task. \"I see that you're in the habit of eating a heavy luncheon. I'm sure it's a mistake. Why don't you follow my example and just eat one thing? I'm sure you'd feel ever so much better for it.\" \"I am only going to eat one thing,\" I said, as the waiter came again with the bill of fare. She waved him aside with an airy gesture. \"No, no, I never eat anything for luncheon. Just a bite, I never want more than that, and I eat that more as an excuse for conversation than anything else. I couldn\u2019t possibly eat anything more unless they had some of those giant asparagus. I should be sorry to leave Paris without having some of them.\" My heart sank. I had seen them in the shops and I knew that they were horribly expensive. My mouth had often watered at the sight of them. \"Madame wants to know if you have any of those giant asparagus,\" I asked the waiter. I tried with all my might to will him to say no. A happy smile spread over his broad, priest-like face, and he assured me that they had some so large, so splendid, so tender, that it was a marvel. \"I'm not in the least hungry,\" my guest sighed, \"but if you insist I don't mind having some asparagus.\" I ordered them. \"Aren't you going to have any?\" \"No, I never eat asparagus.\" \"I know there are people who don't like them. The fact is, you ruin your palate by all the meat you eat.\" We waited for the asparagus to be cooked. Panic seized me. It was not a question now how much money I should have left over for the rest of the month, but whether I had enough to pay the bill. It would be mortifying to find myself ten francs short and be obliged to borrow from my guest. I could not bring myself to do that. I knew exactly how much money I had, and if the bill came to more I made up my mind that I would put my hand in my pocket and with a dramatic cry start up and say it had been picked. Of course, it would be awkward if she had not money enough either to pay the bill. Then the only thing would be to leave my watch and say I would come back and pay later. The asparagus appeared. They were enormous, succulent and appetizing. The smell of the melted butter tickled my nostrils as the nostrils of Jehovah were tickled by the burned offerings of the virtuous Semites. I watched the abandoned woman thrust them down her throat in large voluptuous mouthfuls, and in my polite way I discoursed on the condition of the drama in the Balkans. At last she finished. \"Coffee?\" I said. \"Yes, just an ice-cream and coffee,\" she answered. I was past caring now, so I ordered coffee for myself and an ice-cream and coffee for her. \"You know, there's one thing I thoroughly believe in,\" she said, as she ate the ice-cream. \"One should always get up from a meal feeling one could eat a little more.\" \"Are you still hungry?\" I asked faintly. \"Oh, no, I'm not hungry; you see, I don't eat luncheon. I have a cup of coffee in the morning and then dinner, but I never eat more than one thing for luncheon. I was speaking for you.\" \"Oh, I see!\" Then a terrible thing happened. While we were waiting for the coffee, the head waiter, with an ingratiating smile on his false face, came up to us bearing a large basket full of huge peaches. They had the blush of an innocent girl; they had the rich tone of an Italian landscape. But surely peaches were not in season then? Lord knew what they cost. I knew too \u2014 a little later, for my guest, going on with her conversation, absentmindedly took one. \"You see, you've filled your stomach with a lot of meat\u201d \u2014 my one miserable little chop\u2014 \u201cand you can't eat any more. But I've just had a snack and I shall enjoy a peach.\" The bill came, and when I paid it I found that I had only enough for a quite inadequate tip. Her eyes rested for an instant on the three francs I left for the waiter, and I knew that she thought me mean. But when I walked out of the restaurant I had the whole month before me and not a penny in my pocket. \"Follow my example,\" she said as we shook hands, \"and never eat more than one thing for luncheon.\" \"I'll do better than that,\" I retorted. \"I'll eat nothing for dinner tonight.\" \"Humorist!\" she cried gaily, jumping into a cab. \"You're quite a humorist!\" But I have had my revenge at last. I do not believe that I am a vindictive man, but when the immortal gods take a hand in the matter it is pardonable to observe the result with complacency. Today she weighs twenty-one stone.

To one side of the house there was a garden neatly patterned with plots of growing vegetables, and an arbor for the grapes which ripened late in August. Before the house there were three mighty oaks which sheltered it in their clean and massive shade in summer, and to the other side there was a border of gay flowers. The whole place had an air of tidiness, thrift, and modest comfort. Every day, a few minutes after two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the limited express between two cities passed this spot. At that moment the great train, having halted for a breathing-space at the town near by, was beginning to lengthen evenly into its stroke, but it had not yet reached the full drive of its terrific speed. It swung into view deliberately, swept past with a powerful swaying motion of the engine, a low smooth rumble of its heavy cars upon pressed steel, and then it vanished in the cut. For a moment the progress of the engine could be marked by heavy bellowing puffs of smoke that burst at spaced intervals above the edges of the meadow grass, and finally nothing could be heard but the solid clacking tempo of the wheels receding into the drowsy stillness of the afternoon. Every day for more than twenty years, as the train had approached this house, the engineer had blown on the whistle, and every day, as soon as she heard this signal, a woman had appeared on the back porch of the little house and waved to him. At first she had a small child clinging to her skirts, and now this child had grown to full womanhood, and every day she, too, came with her mother to the porch and waved. The engineer had grown old and gray in service. He had driven his great train, loaded with its weight of lives, across the land ten thousand times. His own children had grown up and married, and four times he had seen before him on the tracks the ghastly dot of tragedy converging like a cannon ball to its eclipse of horror at the boiler head\u2014a light spring wagon filled with children, with its clustered row of small stunned faces; a cheap automobile stalled upon the tracks, set with the wooden figures of people paralyzed with fear; a battered hobo walking by the rail, too deaf and old to hear the whistle\u2019s warning; and a form flung past his window with a scream\u2014all this the man had seen and known. He had known all the grief, the joy, the peril and the labor such a man could know; he had grown seamed and weathered in his loyal service, and now, schooled by the qualities of faith and courage and humbleness that attended his labor, he had grown old, and had the grandeur and the wisdom these men have. But no matter what peril or tragedy he had known, the vision of the little house and the women waving to him with a brave free motion of the arm had become fixed in the mind of the engineer as something beautiful and enduring, something beyond all change and ruin, and something that would always be the same, no matter what mishap, grief or error might break the iron schedule of his days. The sight of the little house and of these two women gave him the most extraordinary happiness he had ever known. He had seen them in a thousand lights, a hundred weathers. He had seen them through the harsh bare light of wintry gray across the brown and frosted stubble of the earth, and he had seen them again in the green luring sorcery of April. He felt for them and for the little house in which they lived such tenderness as a man might feel for his own children, and at length the picture of their lives was carved so sharply in his heart that he felt that he knew their lives completely, to every hour and moment of the day, and he resolved that one day, when his years of service should be ended, he would go and find these people and speak at last with them whose lives had been so wrought into his own. That day came. At last the engineer stepped from a train onto the station platform of the town where these two women lived. His years upon the rail had ended. He was a pensioned servant of his company, with no more work to do. The engineer walked slowly through the station and out into the streets of the town. Everything was as strange to him as if he had never seen this town before. As he walked on, his sense of bewilderment and confusion grew. Could this be the town he had passed ten thousand times? Were these the same houses he had seen so often from the high windows of his cab? It was all as unfamiliar, as disquieting as a city in a dream, and the perplexity of his spirit increased as he went on. Presently the houses thinned into the straggling outposts of the town, and the street faded into a country road\u2014the one on which the women lived. And the man plodded on slowly in the heat and dust. At length he stood before the house he sought. He knew at once that he had found the proper place. He saw the lordly oaks before the house, the flower beds, the garden and the arbor, and farther off, the glint of rails. Yes, this was the house he sought, the place he had passed so many times, the destination he had longed for with such happiness. But now that he had found it, now that he was here, why did his hand falter on the gate; why had the town, the road, the earth, the very entrance to this place he loved turned unfamiliar as the landscape of some ugly dreams? Why did he now feel this sense of confusion, doubt and hopelessness? At length he entered by the gate, walked slowly up the path and in a moment more had mounted three short steps that led up to the porch, and was knocking at the door. Presently he heard steps in the hall, the door was opened, and a woman stood facing him. And instantly, with a sense of bitter loss and grief, he was sorry he had come. He knew at once that the woman who stood there looking at him with a mistrustful eye was the same woman who had waved to him so many thousand times. But her face was harsh and pinched and meager; the flesh sagged wearily in sallow folds, and the small eyes peered at him with timid suspicion and uneasy doubt. All the brave freedom, the warmth and the affection that he had read into her gesture, vanished in the moment that he saw her and heard her unfriendly tongue. And now his own voice sounded unreal and ghastly to him as he tried to explain his presence, to tell her who he was and the reason he had come. But he faltered on, fighting stubbornly against the horror of regret, confusion, disbelief that surged up in his spirit, drowning all his former joy and making his act of hope and tenderness seem shameful to him. At length the woman invited him almost unwillingly into the house, and called her daughter in a harsh shrill voice. Then, for a brief agony of time, the man sat in an ugly little parlor, and he tried to talk while the two women stared at him with a dull, bewildered hostility, a sullen, timorous restraint. And finally, stammering a crude farewell, he departed. He walked away down the path and then along the road toward town, and suddenly he knew that he was an old man. His heart, which had been brave and confident when it looked along the familiar vista of the rails, was now sick with doubt and horror as it saw the strange and unsuspected visage of the earth which had always been within a stone\u2019s throw of him, and which he had never seen or known. And he knew that all the magic of that bright lost way, the vista of that shining line, the imagined corner of that small good universe of hope\u2019s desire, was gone forever, could never be got back again.

To one side of the house there was a garden neatly patterned with plots of growing vegetables, and an arbor for the grapes which ripened late in August. Before the house there were three mighty oaks which sheltered it in their clean and massive shade in summer, and to the other side there was a border of gay flowers. The whole place had an air of tidiness, thrift, and modest comfort. Every day, a few minutes after two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the limited express between two cities passed this spot. At that moment the great train, having halted for a breathing-space at the town near by, was beginning to lengthen evenly into its stroke, but it had not yet reached the full drive of its terrific speed. It swung into view deliberately, swept past with a powerful swaying motion of the engine, a low smooth rumble of its heavy cars upon pressed steel, and then it vanished in the cut. For a moment the progress of the engine could be marked by heavy bellowing puffs of smoke that burst at spaced intervals above the edges of the meadow grass, and finally nothing could be heard but the solid clacking tempo of the wheels receding into the drowsy stillness of the afternoon. Every day for more than twenty years, as the train had approached this house, the engineer had blown on the whistle, and every day, as soon as she heard this signal, a woman had appeared on the back porch of the little house and waved to him. At first she had a small child clinging to her skirts, and now this child had grown to full womanhood, and every day she, too, came with her mother to the porch and waved. The engineer had grown old and gray in service. He had driven his great train, loaded with its weight of lives, across the land ten thousand times. His own children had grown up and married, and four times he had seen before him on the tracks the ghastly dot of tragedy converging like a cannon ball to its eclipse of horror at the boiler head\u2014a light spring wagon filled with children, with its clustered row of small stunned faces; a cheap automobile stalled upon the tracks, set with the wooden figures of people paralyzed with fear; a battered hobo walking by the rail, too deaf and old to hear the whistle\u2019s warning; and a form flung past his window with a scream\u2014all this the man had seen and known. He had known all the grief, the joy, the peril and the labor such a man could know; he had grown seamed and weathered in his loyal service, and now, schooled by the qualities of faith and courage and humbleness that attended his labor, he had grown old, and had the grandeur and the wisdom these men have. But no matter what peril or tragedy he had known, the vision of the little house and the women waving to him with a brave free motion of the arm had become fixed in the mind of the engineer as something beautiful and enduring, something beyond all change and ruin, and something that would always be the same, no matter what mishap, grief or error might break the iron schedule of his days. The sight of the little house and of these two women gave him the most extraordinary happiness he had ever known. He had seen them in a thousand lights, a hundred weathers. He had seen them through the harsh bare light of wintry gray across the brown and frosted stubble of the earth, and he had seen them again in the green luring sorcery of April. He felt for them and for the little house in which they lived such tenderness as a man might feel for his own children, and at length the picture of their lives was carved so sharply in his heart that he felt that he knew their lives completely, to every hour and moment of the day, and he resolved that one day, when his years of service should be ended, he would go and find these people and speak at last with them whose lives had been so wrought into his own. That day came. At last the engineer stepped from a train onto the station platform of the town where these two women lived. His years upon the rail had ended. He was a pensioned servant of his company, with no more work to do. The engineer walked slowly through the station and out into the streets of the town. Everything was as strange to him as if he had never seen this town before. As he walked on, his sense of bewilderment and confusion grew. Could this be the town he had passed ten thousand times? Were these the same houses he had seen so often from the high windows of his cab? It was all as unfamiliar, as disquieting as a city in a dream, and the perplexity of his spirit increased as he went on. Presently the houses thinned into the straggling outposts of the town, and the street faded into a country road\u2014the one on which the women lived. And the man plodded on slowly in the heat and dust. At length he stood before the house he sought. He knew at once that he had found the proper place. He saw the lordly oaks before the house, the flower beds, the garden and the arbor, and farther off, the glint of rails. Yes, this was the house he sought, the place he had passed so many times, the destination he had longed for with such happiness. But now that he had found it, now that he was here, why did his hand falter on the gate; why had the town, the road, the earth, the very entrance to this place he loved turned unfamiliar as the landscape of some ugly dreams?

He was a man of exuberant fancy, and, withal, of an authority so irresistible that, at his will, he turned his varied fancies into facts. He was greatly given to self-communing, and, when he and himself agreed upon anything, the thing was done. When every member of his domestic and political systems moved smoothly in its appointed course, his nature was bland and genial; but, whenever there was a little hitch, and some of his orbs got out of their orbits, he was blander and more genial still, for nothing pleased him so much as to make the crooked straight and crush down uneven places. Among the borrowed notions by which his barbarism had become semified was that of the public arena, in which, by exhibitions of manly and beastly valor, the minds of his subjects were refined and cultured. But even here the exuberant and barbaric fancy asserted itself. The arena of the king was built, not to give the people an opportunity of hearing the rhapsodies of dying gladiators, nor to enable them to view the inevitable conclusion of a conflict between religious opinions and hungry jaws, but for purposes far better adapted to widen and develop the mental energies of the people. This vast amphitheater, with its encircling galleries, its mysterious vaults, and its unseen passages, was an agent of poetic justice, in which crime was punished, or virtue rewarded, by the decrees of an impartial and incorruptible chance. When a subject was accused of a crime of sufficient importance to interest the king, public notice was given that on an appointed day the fate of the accused person would be decided in the king's arena, a structure which well deserved its name, for, although its form and plan were borrowed from afar, its purpose emanated solely from the brain of this man, who, every barleycorn a king, knew no tradition to which he owed more allegiance than pleased his fancy, and who ingrafted on every adopted form of human thought and action the rich growth of his barbaric idealism. When all the people had assembled in the galleries, and the king, surrounded by his court, sat high up on his throne of royal state on one side of the arena, he gave a signal, a door beneath him opened, and the accused subject stepped out into the amphitheater. Directly opposite him, on the other side of the enclosed space, were two doors, exactly alike and side by side. It was the duty and the privilege of the person on trial to walk directly to these doors and open one of them. He could open either door he pleased; he was subject to no guidance or influence but that of the aforementioned impartial and incorruptible chance. If he opened the one, there came out of it a hungry tiger, the fiercest and most cruel that could be procured, which immediately sprang upon him and tore him to pieces as a punishment for his guilt. The moment that the case of the criminal was thus decided, doleful iron bells were clanged, great wails went up from the hired mourners posted on the outer rim of the arena, and the vast audience, with bowed heads and downcast hearts, wended slowly their homeward way, mourning greatly that one so young and fair, or so old and respected, should have merited so dire a fate. But, if the accused person opened the other door, there came forth from it a lady, the most suitable to his years and station that his majesty could select among his fair subjects, and to this lady he was immediately married, as a reward of his innocence. It mattered not that he might already possess a wife and family, or that his affections might be engaged upon an object of his own selection; the king allowed no such subordinate arrangements to interfere with his great scheme of retribution and reward. The exercises, as in the other instance, took place immediately, and in the arena. Another door opened beneath the king, and a priest, followed by a band of choristers, and dancing maidens blowing joyous airs on golden horns advanced to where the pair stood, side by side, and the wedding was promptly and cheerily solemnized. Then the gay brass bells rang forth their merry peals, the people shouted glad hurrahs, and the innocent man, preceded by children strewing flowers on his path, led his bride to his home. This was the king's semi-barbaric method of administering justice. Its perfect fairness is obvious. The criminal could not know out of which door would come the lady; he opened either he pleased, without having the slightest idea whether, in the next instant, he was to be devoured or married. On some occasions the tiger came out of one door, and on some out of the other. The decisions of this tribunal were not only fair, they were positively determinate: the accused person was instantly punished if he found himself guilty, and, if innocent, he was rewarded on the spot, whether he liked it or not. There was no escape from the judgments of the king's arena. The institution was a very popular one. When the people gathered together on one of the great trial days, they never knew whether they were to witness a bloody slaughter or a hilarious wedding. This element of uncertainty lent an interest to the occasion which it could not otherwise have attained. Thus, the masses were entertained and pleased, and the thinking part of the community could bring no charge of unfairness against this plan, for did not the accused person have the whole matter in his own hands? This semi-barbaric king had a daughter as blooming as his most florid fancies, and with a soul as fervent and imperious as his own. As is usual in such cases, she was the apple of his eye, and was loved by him above all humanity. Among his courtiers was a young man of that fineness of blood and lowness of station common to the conventional heroes of romance who love royal maidens. This royal maiden was well satisfied with her lover, for he was handsome and brave to a degree unsurpassed in all this kingdom, and she loved him with an ardor that had enough of barbarism in it to make it exceedingly warm and strong. This love affair moved on happily for many months, until one day the king happened to discover its existence. He did not hesitate nor waver in regard to his duty in the premises. The youth was immediately cast into prison, and a day was appointed for his trial in the king's arena. This, of course, was an especially important occasion, and his majesty, as well as all the people, was greatly interested in the workings and development of this trial. Never before had such a case occurred; never before had a subject dared to love the daughter of the king. In after years such things became commonplace enough, but then they were in no slight degree novel and startling. The tiger-cages of the kingdom were searched for the most savage and relentless beasts, from which the fiercest monster might be selected for the arena; and the ranks of maiden youth and beauty throughout the land were carefully surveyed by competent judges in order that the young man might have a fitting bride in case fate did not determine for him a different destiny. Of course, everybody knew that the deed with which the accused was charged had been done. He had loved the princess, and neither he, she, nor any one else, thought of denying the fact; but the king would not think of allowing any fact of this kind to interfere with the workings of the tribunal, in which he took such great delight and satisfaction. No matter how the affair turned out, the youth would be disposed of, and the king would take an aesthetic pleasure in watching the course of events, which would determine whether or not the young man had done wrong in allowing himself to love the princess. The appointed day arrived. From far and near the people gathered, and thronged the great galleries of the arena, and crowds, unable to gain admittance, massed themselves against its outside walls. The king and his court were in their places, opposite the twin doors, those fateful portals, so terrible in their similarity. All was ready. The signal was given. A door beneath the royal party opened, and the lover of the princess walked into the arena. Tall, beautiful, fair, his appearance was greeted with a low hum of admiration and anxiety. Half the audience had not known so grand a youth had lived among them. No wonder the princess loved him! What a terrible thing for him to be there! As the youth advanced into the arena he turned, as the custom was, to bow to the king, but he did not think at all of that royal personage. His eyes were fixed upon the princess, who sat to the right of her father. Had it not been for the moiety of barbarism in her nature it is probable that lady would not have been there, but her intense and fervid soul would not allow her to be absent on an occasion in which she was so terribly interested. From the moment that the decree had gone forth that her lover should decide his fate in the king's arena, she had thought of nothing, night or day, but this great event and the various subjects connected with it. Possessed of more power, influence, and force of character than any one who had ever before been interested in such a case, she had done what no other person had done\u2014she had possessed herself of the secret of the doors. She knew in which of the two rooms, that lay behind those doors, stood the cage of the tiger, with its open front, and in which waited the lady. Through these thick doors, heavily curtained with skins on the inside, it was impossible that any noise or suggestion should come from within to the person who should approach to raise the latch of one of them. But gold, and the power of a woman's will, had brought the secret to the princess. And not only did she know in which room stood the lady ready to emerge, all blushing and radiant, should her door be opened, but she knew who the lady was. It was one of the fairest and loveliest of the damsels of the court who had been selected as the reward of the accused youth, should he be proved innocent of the crime of aspiring to one so far above him; and the princess hated her. Often had she seen, or imagined that she had seen, this fair creature throwing glances of admiration upon the person of her lover, and sometimes she thought these glances were perceived, and even returned. Now and then she had seen them talking together; it was but for a moment or two, but much can be said in a brief space; it may have been on most unimportant topics, but how could she know that? The girl was lovely, but she had dared to raise her eyes to the loved one of the princess; and, with all the intensity of the savage blood transmitted to her through long lines of wholly barbaric ancestors, she hated the woman who blushed and trembled behind that silent door. When her lover turned and looked at her, and his eye met hers as she sat there, paler and whiter than any one in the vast ocean of anxious faces about her, he saw, by that power of quick perception which is given to those whose souls are one, that she knew behind which door crouched the tiger, and behind which stood the lady. He had expected her to know it. He understood her nature, and his soul was assured that she would never rest until she had made plain to herself this thing, hidden to all other lookers-on, even to the king. The only hope for the youth in which there was any element of certainty was based upon the success of the princess in discovering this mystery; and the moment he looked upon her, he saw she had succeeded, as in his soul he knew she would succeed. Then it was that his quick and anxious glance asked the question: \"Which?\" It was as plain to her as if he shouted it from where he stood. There was not an instant to be lost. The question was asked in a flash; it must be answered in another. Her right arm lay on the cushioned parapet before her. She raised her hand, and made a slight, quick movement toward the right. No one but her lover saw her. Every eye but his was fixed on the man in the arena. He turned, and with a firm and rapid step he walked across the empty space. Every heart stopped beating, every breath was held, every eye was fixed immovably upon that man. Without the slightest hesitation, he went to the door on the right, and opened it. Now, the point of the story is this: Did the tiger come out of that door, or did the lady ? The more we reflect upon this question, the harder it is to answer. It involves a study of the human heart which leads us through devious mazes of passion, out of which it is difficult to find our way. Think of it, fair reader, not as if the decision of the question depended upon yourself, but upon that hot-blooded, semi-barbaric princess, her soul at a white heat beneath the combined fires of despair and jealousy. She had lost him, but who should have him? How often, in her waking hours and in her dreams, had she started in wild horror, and covered her face with her hands as she thought of her lover opening the door on the other side of which waited the cruel fangs of the tiger! But how much oftener had she seen him at the other door! How in her grievous reveries had she gnashed her teeth, and torn her hair, when she saw his start of rapturous delight as he opened the door of the lady! How her soul had burned in agony when she had seen him rush to meet that woman, with her flushing cheek and sparkling eye of triumph; when she had seen him lead her forth, his whole frame kindled with the joy of recovered life; when she had heard the glad shouts from the multitude, and the wild ringing of the happy bells; when she had seen the priest, with his joyous followers, advance to the couple, and make them man and wife before her very eyes; and when she had seen them walk away together upon their path of flowers, followed by the tremendous shouts of the hilarious multitude, in which her one despairing shriek was lost and drowned! Would it not be better for him to die at once, and go to wait for her in the blessed regions of semi-barbaric futurity? And yet, that awful tiger, those shrieks, that blood! Her decision had been indicated in an instant, but it had been made after days and nights of anguished deliberation. She had known she would be asked, she had decided what she would answer, and, without the slightest hesitation, she had moved her hand to the right. The question of her decision is one not to be lightly considered, and it is not for me to presume to set myself up as the one person able to answer it.

The king and his court were in their places, opposite the twin doors, those fateful portals, so terrible in their similarity. All was ready. The signal was given. A door beneath the royal party opened, and the lover of the princess walked into the arena. Tall, beautiful, fair, his appearance was greeted with a low hum of admiration and anxiety. Half the audience had not known so grand a youth had lived among them. No wonder the princess loved him! What a terrible thing for him to be there! As the youth advanced into the arena he turned, as the custom was, to bow to the king, but he did not think at all of that royal personage. His eyes were fixed upon the princess, who sat to the right of her father. Had it not been for the moiety of barbarism in her nature it is probable that lady would not have been there, but her intense and fervid soul would not allow her to be absent on an occasion in which she was so terribly interested. From the moment that the decree had gone forth that her lover should decide his fate in the king's arena, she had thought of nothing, night or day, but this great event and the various subjects connected with it. Possessed of more power, influence, and force of character than any one who had ever before been interested in such a case, she had done what no other person had done\u2014she had possessed herself of the secret of the doors. She knew in which of the two rooms, that lay behind those doors, stood the cage of the tiger, with its open front, and in which waited the lady. Through these thick doors, heavily curtained with skins on the inside, it was impossible that any noise or suggestion should come from within to the person who should approach to raise the latch of one of them. But gold, and the power of a woman's will, had brought the secret to the princess. And not only did she know in which room stood the lady ready to emerge, all blushing and radiant, should her door be opened, but she knew who the lady was. It was one of the fairest and loveliest of the damsels of the court who had been selected as the reward of the accused youth, should he be proved innocent of the crime of aspiring to one so far above him; and the princess hated her. Often had she seen, or imagined that she had seen, this fair creature throwing glances of admiration upon the person of her lover, and sometimes she thought these glances were perceived, and even returned. Now and then she had seen them talking together; it was but for a moment or two, but much can be said in a brief space; it may have been on most unimportant topics, but how could she know that? The girl was lovely, but she had dared to raise her eyes to the loved one of the princess; and, with all the intensity of the savage blood transmitted to her through long lines of wholly barbaric ancestors, she hated the woman who blushed and trembled behind that silent door. When her lover turned and looked at her, and his eye met hers as she sat there, paler and whiter than any one in the vast ocean of anxious faces about her, he saw, by that power of quick perception which is given to those whose souls are one, that she knew behind which door crouched the tiger, and behind which stood the lady. He had expected her to know it. He understood her nature, and his soul was assured that she would never rest until she had made plain to herself this thing, hidden to all other lookers-on, even to the king. The only hope for the youth in which there was any element of certainty was based upon the success of the princess in discovering this mystery; and the moment he looked upon her, he saw she had succeeded, as in his soul he knew she would succeed. Then it was that his quick and anxious glance asked the question: \"Which?\" It was as plain to her as if he shouted it from where he stood. There was not an instant to be lost. The question was asked in a flash; it must be answered in another. Her right arm lay on the cushioned parapet before her. She raised her hand, and made a slight, quick movement toward the right. No one but her lover saw her. Every eye but his was fixed on the man in the arena. He turned, and with a firm and rapid step he walked across the empty space. Every heart stopped beating, every breath was held, every eye was fixed immovably upon that man. Without the slightest hesitation, he went to the door on the right, and opened it. Now, the point of the story is this: Did the tiger come out of that door, or did the lady ? The more we reflect upon this question, the harder it is to answer. It involves a study of the human heart which leads us through devious mazes of passion, out of which it is difficult to find our way. Think of it, fair reader, not as if the decision of the question depended upon yourself, but upon that hot-blooded, semi-barbaric princess, her soul at a white heat beneath the combined fires of despair and jealousy. She had lost him, but who should have him? How often, in her waking hours and in her dreams, had she started in wild horror, and covered her face with her hands as she thought of her lover opening the door on the other side of which waited the cruel fangs of the tiger! But how much oftener had she seen him at the other door! How in her grievous reveries had she gnashed her teeth, and torn her hair, when she saw his start of rapturous delight as he opened the door of the lady! How her soul had burned in agony when she had seen him rush to meet that woman, with her flushing cheek and sparkling eye of triumph; when she had seen him lead her forth, his whole frame kindled with the joy of recovered life; when she had heard the glad shouts from the multitude, and the wild ringing of the happy bells; when she had seen the priest, with his joyous followers, advance to the couple, and make them man and wife before her very eyes; and when she had seen them walk away together upon their path of flowers, followed by the tremendous shouts of the hilarious multitude, in which her one despairing shriek was lost and drowned! Would it not be better for him to die at once, and go to wait for her in the blessed regions of semi-barbaric futurity? And yet, that awful tiger, those shrieks, that blood! Her decision had been indicated in an instant, but it had been made after days and nights of anguished deliberation. She had known she would be asked, she had decided what she would answer, and, without the slightest hesitation, she had moved her hand to the right. The question of her decision is one not to be lightly considered, and it is not for me to presume to set myself up as the one person able to answer it. And so I leave it with all of you: Which came out of the opened door\u2014 the lady, or the tiger?","title":"The Lady or the Tiger?"},{"location":"course/week7/#preparation-questions","text":"1.What is the setting of the story?

The disease had sharpened my senses\u2014not destroyed\u2014not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily\u2014how calmly I can tell you the whole story. It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture\u2014a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees\u2014very gradually\u2014I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever. Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me . You should have seen how wisely I proceeded\u2014with what caution\u2014with what foresight\u2014with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it\u2014oh, so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly\u2014very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man\u2019s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha!\u2014would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously\u2014oh, so cautiously\u2014cautiously (for the hinges creaked)\u2014I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights\u2014every night just at midnight\u2014but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept. Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch\u2019s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers\u2014of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back\u2014but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers), and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in the bed, crying out\u2014\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening;\u2014just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall. Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief\u2014oh, no!\u2014it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself\u2014\u201cIt is nothing but the wind in the chimney\u2014it is only a mouse crossing the floor,\u201d or \u201cit is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.\u201d Yes, he has been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain ; because Death, in approaching him, had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel\u2014although he neither saw nor heard\u2014to feel the presence of my head within the room. When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little\u2014a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it\u2014you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily\u2014until, at length a single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell upon the vulture eye. It was open\u2014wide, wide open\u2014and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness\u2014all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man\u2019s face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot. And now have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over- acuteness of the senses?\u2014now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man\u2019s heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage. But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man\u2019s terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!\u2014do you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me\u2014the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man\u2019s hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once\u2014once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more. If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs. I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye\u2014not even his \u2014could have detected anything wrong. There was nothing to wash out\u2014no stain of any kind\u2014no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all\u2014ha! ha! When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o\u2019clock\u2014still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart\u2014for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises. I smiled,\u2014for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search\u2014search well . I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim. The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct:\u2014it continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definitiveness\u2014until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears. No doubt I now grew very pale;\u2014but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased\u2014and what could I do? It was a low , dull , quick sound \u2014 much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton . I gasped for breath\u2014and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly\u2014more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observation of the men\u2014but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed\u2014I raved\u2014I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder\u2014louder\u2014 louder ! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! \u2014no, no! They heard!\u2014they suspected!\u2014they knew !\u2014they were making a mockery of my horror! \u2014this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die!\u2014and now\u2014again!\u2014hark! louder! louder! louder! louder ! \u2014 \u201cVillains!\u201d I shrieked, \u201cdissemble no more!

It was a low , dull , quick sound \u2014 much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton . I gasped for breath\u2014and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly\u2014more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observation of the men\u2014but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed\u2014I raved\u2014I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder\u2014louder\u2014 louder ! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! \u2014no, no! They heard!\u2014they suspected!\u2014they knew !\u2014they were making a mockery of my horror! \u2014this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer!

The air was motionless, but when you opened your mouth there was just a faint chill, like a chill from a glass of iced water before you sip, and now and again a leaf came drifting\u2014from nowhere, from the sky. Miss Brill put up her hand and touched her fur. Dear little thing! It was nice to feel it again. She had taken it out of its box that afternoon, shaken out the moth-powder, given it a good brush, and rubbed the life back into the dim little eyes. \"What has been happening to me?\" said the sad little eyes. Oh, how sweet it was to see them snap at her again from the red eiderdown! ... But the nose, which was of some black composition, wasn't at all firm. It must have had a knock, somehow. Never mind\u2014a little dab of black sealing-wax when the time came\u2014 when it was absolutely necessary ... Little rogue! Yes, she really felt like that about it. Little rogue biting its tail just by her left ear. She could have taken it off and laid it on her lap and stroked it. She felt a tingling in her hands and arms, but that came from walking, she supposed. And when she breathed, something light and sad\u2014no, not sad, exactly\u2014something gentle seemed to move in her bosom. There were a number of people out this afternoon, far more than last Sunday. And the band sounded louder and gayer. That was because the Season had begun. For although the band played all the year round on Sundays, out of season it was never the same. It was like some one playing with only the family to listen; it didn't care how it played if there weren't any strangers present. Wasn't the conductor wearing a new coat, too? She was sure it was new. He scraped with his foot and flapped his arms like a rooster about to crow, and the bandsmen sitting in the green rotunda blew out their cheeks and glared at the music. Now there came a little \"flutey\" bit\u2014very pretty! \u2014a little chain of bright drops. She was sure it would be repeated. It was; she lifted her head and smiled. Only two people shared her \"special\" seat: a fine old man in a velvet coat, his hands clasped over a huge carved walking-stick, and a big old woman, sitting upright, with a roll of knitting on her embroidered apron. They did not speak. This was disappointing, for Miss Brill always looked forward to the conversation. She had become really quite expert, she thought, at listening as though she didn't listen, at sitting in other people's lives just for a minute while they talked round her. She glanced, sideways, at the old couple. Perhaps they would go soon. Last Sunday, too, hadn't been as interesting as usual. An Englishman and his wife, he wearing a dreadful Panama hat and she button boots. And she'd gone on the whole time about how she ought to wear spectacles; she knew she needed them; but that it was no good getting any; they'd be sure to break and they'd never keep on. And he'd been so patient. He'd suggested everything\u2014gold rims, the kind that curved round your ears, little pads inside the bridge. No, nothing would please her. \"They'll always be sliding down my nose!\" Miss Brill had wanted to shake her. The old people sat on the bench, still as statues. Never mind, there was always the crowd to watch. To and fro, in front of the flower-beds and the band rotunda, the couples and groups paraded, stopped to talk, to greet, to buy a handful of flowers from the old beggar who had his tray fixed to the railings. Little children ran among them, swooping and laughing; little boys with big white silk bows under their chins, little girls, little French dolls, dressed up in velvet and lace. And sometimes a tiny staggerer came suddenly rocking into the open from under the trees, stopped, stared, as suddenly sat down \"flop,\" until its small high-stepping mother, like a young hen, rushed scolding to its rescue. Other people sat on the benches and green chairs, but they were nearly always the same, Sunday after Sunday, and\u2014Miss Brill had often noticed\u2014there was something funny about nearly all of them. They were odd, silent, nearly all old, and from the way they stared they looked as though they'd just come from dark little rooms or even\u2014even cupboards! Behind the rotunda the slender trees with yellow leaves down drooping, and through them just a line of sea, and beyond the blue sky with gold-veined clouds. Tum-tum-tum tiddle-um! tiddle-um! tum tiddley-um tum ta! blew the band. Two young girls in red came by and two young soldiers in blue met them, and they laughed and paired and went off arm-in-arm. Two peasant women with funny straw hats passed, gravely, leading beautiful smoke-colored donkeys. A cold, pale nun hurried by. A beautiful woman came along and dropped her bunch of violets, and a little boy ran after to hand them to her, and she took them and threw them away as if they'd been poisoned. Dear me! Miss Brill didn't know whether to admire that or not! And now an ermine toque and a gentleman in grey met just in front of her. He was tall, stiff, dignified, and she was wearing the ermine toque she'd bought when her hair was yellow. Now everything, her hair, her face, even her eyes, was the same color as the shabby ermine, and her hand, in its cleaned glove, lifted to dab her lips, was a tiny yellowish paw. Oh, she was so pleased to see him\u2014delighted! She rather thought they were going to meet that afternoon. She described where she'd been\u2014everywhere, here, there, along by the sea. The day was so charming\u2014didn't he agree? And wouldn't he, perhaps? ... But he shook his head, lighted a cigarette, slowly breathed a great deep puff into her face, and, even while she was still talking and laughing, flicked the match away and walked on. The ermine toque was alone; she smiled more brightly than ever. But even the band seemed to know what she was feeling and played more softly, played tenderly, and the drum beat, \"The Brute! The Brute!\" over and over. What would she do? What was going to happen now? But as Miss Brill wondered, the ermine toque turned, raised her hand as though she'd seen some one else, much nicer, just over there, and pattered away. And the band changed again and played more quickly, more gayly than ever, and the old couple on Miss Brill's seat got up and marched away, and such a funny old man with long whiskers hobbled along in time to the music and was nearly knocked over by four girls walking abreast. Oh, how fascinating it was! How she enjoyed it! How she loved sitting here, watching it all! It was like a play. It was exactly like a play. Who could believe the sky at the back wasn't painted? But it wasn't till a little brown dog trotted on solemn and then slowly trotted off, like a little \"theatre\" dog, a little dog that had been drugged, that Miss Brill discovered what it was that made it so exciting. They were all on the stage. They weren't only the audience, not only looking on; they were acting. Even she had a part and came every Sunday. No doubt somebody would have noticed if she hadn't been there; she was part of the performance after all. How strange she'd never thought of it like that before! And yet it explained why she made such a point of starting from home at just the same time each week\u2014so as not to be late for the performance\u2014and it also explained why she had quite a queer, shy feeling at telling her English pupils how she spent her Sunday afternoons. No wonder! Miss Brill nearly laughed out loud. She was on the stage. She thought of the old invalid gentleman to whom she read the newspaper four afternoons a week while he slept in the garden. She had got quite used to the frail head on the cotton pillow, the hollowed eyes, the open mouth and the high pinched nose. If he'd been dead she mightn't have noticed for weeks; she wouldn't have minded. But suddenly he knew he was having the paper read to him by an actress! \"An actress!\" The old head lifted; two points of light quivered in the old eyes. \"An actress\u2014are ye?\" And Miss Brill smoothed the newspaper as though it were the manuscript of her part and said gently: \"Yes, I have been an actress for a long time.\" The band had been having a rest. Now they started again. And what they played was warm, sunny, yet there was just a faint chill\u2014a something, what was it? \u2014not sadness\u2014 no, not sadness\u2014a something that made you want to sing. The tune lifted, lifted, the light shone; and it seemed to Miss Brill that in another moment all of them, all the whole company, would begin singing. The young ones, the laughing ones who were moving together, they would begin, and the men's voices, very resolute and brave, would join them. And then she too, she too, and the others on the benches\u2014they would come in with a kind of accompaniment\u2014something low, that scarcely rose or fell, something so beautiful\u2014moving ... And Miss Brill's eyes filled with tears and she looked smiling at all the other members of the company. Yes, we understand, we understand, she thought\u2014though what they understood she didn't know. Just at that moment a boy and girl came and sat down where the old couple had been. They were beautifully dressed; they were in love. The hero and heroine, of course, just arrived from his father's yacht. And still soundlessly singing, still with that trembling smile, Miss Brill prepared to listen. \"No, not now,\" said the girl. \"Not here, I can't.\" \"But why? Because of that stupid old thing at the end there?\" asked the boy. \"Why does she come here at all\u2014who wants her? Why doesn't she keep her silly old mug at home?\" \"It's her fu-fur which is so funny,\" giggled the girl. \"It's exactly like a fried whiting.\" \"Ah, be off with you!\" said the boy in an angry whisper. Then: \"Tell me, ma petite ch\u00e9re\u2014\" \"No, not here,\" said the girl. \"Not yet .\" On her way home she usually bought a slice of honey-cake at the baker's. It was her Sunday treat. Sometimes there was an almond in her slice, sometimes not. It made a great difference. If there was an almond it was like carrying home a tiny present\u2014a surprise\u2014 something that might very well not have been there. She hurried on the almond Sundays and struck the match for the kettle in quite a dashing way. But today she passed the baker's by, climbed the stairs, went into the little dark room\u2014her room like a cupboard\u2014and sat down on the red eiderdown. She sat there for a long time. The box that the fur came out of was on the bed. She unclasped the necklet quickly; quickly, without looking, laid it inside. But when she put the lid on she thought she heard something crying. ## Plot Summary Miss Brill is an English teacher living near the Public Gardens in a French town. The narrative follows her on a regular Sunday afternoon, which she spends walking about and sitting in the park. The story opens with Miss Brill delighting in her decision to wear her fur. She notices that there are more park-goers than there were last Sunday, and that the band is more enthusiastic because the Season has commenced. Miss Brill observes facets of the lives around her, \"listening as though she didn't listen, ...sitting in other people's lives just for a minute while they talked round her\". She sees the world as a play: as though her surroundings are a set and she and her fellow park-goers actors. She imagines that the band's performance corresponds with and highlights the park's happenings. When the band strikes up a new song, Miss Brill envisions everyone in the park taking part in the song and singing. She begins to cry at the thought. A young couple arrive and share Miss Brill's bench. Miss Brill believes they are nicely dressed and warmly pictures them as the \"hero and heroine\" of the play. However, she overhears the boy make a rude remark about Miss Brill being a \"stupid old thing\", and the girl agrees, \"It's her fu-fur which is so funny.\" On a typical Sunday, Miss Brill would stop by the bakery, but on this particular day, she goes straight home to a dark room. As she returns her fur to its box, Miss Brill \"[thinks] she [hears] something crying\". \u5e03\u91cc\u5c14\u5c0f\u59d0\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u82f1\u8bed\u6559\u5e08\uff0c\u4f4f\u5728\u6cd5\u56fd\u5c0f\u9547\u7684\u516c\u5171\u82b1\u56ed\u9644\u8fd1\u3002\u53d9\u8ff0\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u662f\u8ddf\u7740\u5979\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u666e\u901a\u7684\u661f\u671f\u5929\u4e0b\u5348\uff0c\u5979\u5728\u516c\u56ed\u91cc\u6563\u6b65\u548c\u5750\u7740\u7684\u65e5\u5b50\u3002 \u6545\u4e8b\u4ee5Brill\u5c0f\u59d0\u9ad8\u5174\u5730\u51b3\u5b9a\u7a7f\u4e0a\u5979\u7684\u76ae\u8349\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f00\u573a\u3002\u5979\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u516c\u56ed\u91cc\u7684\u4eba\u6bd4\u4e0a\u4e2a\u661f\u671f\u5929\u591a\u4e86\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e50\u961f\u4e5f\u66f4\u70ed\u60c5\u4e86\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u97f3\u4e50\u5b63\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f00\u59cb\u4e86\u3002\u5e03\u91cc\u5c14\u5c0f\u59d0\u89c2\u5bdf\u7740\u5468\u56f4\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u65b9\u9762\u9762\uff0c\"\u4eff\u4f5b\u5979\u6ca1\u6709\u542c\u8fdb\u53bb\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u5750\u5728\u522b\u4eba\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\uff0c\u542c\u7740\u4ed6\u4eec\u56f4\u7740\u5979\u8bf4\u8bdd\uff0c\u5c31\u4e00\u5206\u949f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\"\u3002\u5979\u628a\u4e16\u754c\u770b\u6210\u4e00\u51fa\u620f\uff1a\u4eff\u4f5b\u5979\u7684\u5468\u56f4\u73af\u5883\u5c31\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e03\u666f\uff0c\u5979\u548c\u5979\u7684\u540c\u4f34\u4eec\u5c31\u662f\u516c\u56ed\u91cc\u7684\u6f14\u5458\u3002\u5979\u60f3\u8c61\u7740\u4e50\u961f\u7684\u8868\u6f14\u4e0e\u516c\u56ed\u91cc\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u76f8\u547c\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u516c\u56ed\u91cc\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u3002\u5f53\u4e50\u961f\u54cd\u8d77\u4e00\u9996\u65b0\u6b4c\u65f6\uff0cBrill\u5c0f\u59d0\u60f3\u8c61\u7740\u516c\u56ed\u91cc\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u53c2\u4e0e\u5230\u8fd9\u9996\u6b4c\u7684\u6f14\u5531\u4e2d\u6765\u3002\u4e00\u60f3\u5230\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u5979\u5c31\u5f00\u59cb\u54ed\u4e86\u3002 \u8fd9\u65f6\uff0c\u4e00\u5bf9\u5e74\u8f7b\u7684\u60c5\u4fa3\u6765\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0eBrill\u5c0f\u59d0\u540c\u5750\u4e00\u5f20\u957f\u6905\u3002\u5e03\u91cc\u5c14\u5c0f\u59d0\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u6253\u626e\u5f97\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u70ed\u60c5\u5730\u628a\u4ed6\u4eec\u60f3\u8c61\u6210\u4e86\u5267\u4e2d\u7684 \"\u7537\u5973\u4e3b\u89d2\"\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5979\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u542c\u5230\u7537\u5b69\u8bf4\u4e86\u4e00\u53e5\u7c97\u9c81\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u8bf4Brill\u5c0f\u59d0\u662f\u4e2a \"\u611a\u8822\u7684\u8001\u4e1c\u897f\"\uff0c\u5973\u5b69\u540c\u610f\u4e86\uff0c\"\u662f\u5979\u7684\u5bcc\u4e8c\u4ee3\u624d\u8fd9\u4e48\u6709\u8da3\u3002\" \u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u7684\u661f\u671f\u5929\uff0cBrill\u5c0f\u59d0\u4f1a\u53bb\u9762\u5305\u5e97\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u65e5\u5b50\uff0c\u5979\u76f4\u63a5\u56de\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ed1\u6697\u7684\u623f\u95f4\u3002\u5f53\u5979\u628a\u76ae\u6bdb\u653e\u56de\u76d2\u5b50\u91cc\u65f6\uff0cBrill\u5c0f\u59d0 \"\u4ee5\u4e3a\u81ea\u5df1\u542c\u5230\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e1c\u897f\u5728\u54ed\"\u3002","title":"\u7b2c\u516b\u7bc7 Miss Brill"},{"location":"course/week9/#miss-brill","text":"Katherine Mansfield Although it was so brilliantly fine\u2014the blue sky powdered with gold and great spots of light like white wine splashed over the Jardins Publiques\u2014Miss Brill was glad that she had decided on her fur.

But he shook his head, lighted a cigarette, slowly breathed a great deep puff into her face, and, even while she was still talking and laughing, flicked the match away and walked on. The ermine toque was alone; she smiled more brightly than ever. But even the band seemed to know what she was feeling and played more softly, played tenderly, and the drum beat, \"The Brute! The Brute!\" over and over. What would she do? What was going to happen now? But as Miss Brill wondered, the ermine toque turned, raised her hand as though she'd seen some one else, much nicer, just over there, and pattered away. And the band changed again and played more quickly, more gayly than ever, and the old couple on Miss Brill's seat got up and marched away, and such a funny old man with long whiskers hobbled along in time to the music and was nearly knocked over by four girls walking abreast. Oh, how fascinating it was! How she enjoyed it! How she loved sitting here, watching it all! It was like a play. It was exactly like a play. Who could believe the sky at the back wasn't painted? But it wasn't till a little brown dog trotted on solemn and then slowly trotted off, like a little \"theatre\" dog, a little dog that had been drugged, that Miss Brill discovered what it was that made it so exciting. They were all on the stage. They weren't only the audience, not only looking on; they were acting. Even she had a part and came every Sunday. No doubt somebody would have noticed if she hadn't been there; she was part of the performance after all. How strange she'd never thought of it like that before! And yet it explained why she made such a point of starting from home at just the same time each week\u2014so as not to be late for the performance\u2014and it also explained why she had quite a queer, shy feeling at telling her English pupils how she spent her Sunday afternoons. No wonder! Miss Brill nearly laughed out loud. She was on the stage. She thought of the old invalid gentleman to whom she read the newspaper four afternoons a week while he slept in the garden. She had got quite used to the frail head on the cotton pillow, the hollowed eyes, the open mouth and the high pinched nose. If he'd been dead she mightn't have noticed for weeks; she wouldn't have minded. But suddenly he knew he was having the paper read to him by an actress! \"An actress!\" The old head lifted; two points of light quivered in the old eyes. \"An actress\u2014are ye?\" And Miss Brill smoothed the newspaper as though it were the manuscript of her part and said gently: \"Yes, I have been an actress for a long time.\" The band had been having a rest. Now they started again. And what they played was warm, sunny, yet there was just a faint chill\u2014a something, what was it? \u2014not sadness\u2014 no, not sadness\u2014a something that made you want to sing. The tune lifted, lifted, the light shone; and it seemed to Miss Brill that in another moment all of them, all the whole company, would begin singing. The young ones, the laughing ones who were moving together, they would begin, and the men's voices, very resolute and brave, would join them. And then she too, she too, and the others on the benches\u2014they would come in with a kind of accompaniment\u2014something low, that scarcely rose or fell, something so beautiful\u2014moving ... And Miss Brill's eyes filled with tears and she looked smiling at all the other members of the company. Yes, we understand, we understand, she thought\u2014though what they understood she didn't know. Just at that moment a boy and girl came and sat down where the old couple had been. They were beautifully dressed; they were in love. The hero and heroine, of course, just arrived from his father's yacht. And still soundlessly singing, still with that trembling smile, Miss Brill prepared to listen. \"No, not now,\" said the girl. \"Not here, I can't.\" \"But why? Because of that stupid old thing at the end there?\" asked the boy. \"Why does she come here at all\u2014who wants her? Why doesn't she keep her silly old mug at home?\" \"It's her fu-fur which is so funny,\" giggled the girl. \"It's exactly like a fried whiting.\" \"Ah, be off with you!\" said the boy in an angry whisper. Then: \"Tell me, ma petite ch\u00e9re\u2014\" \"No, not here,\" said the girl. \"Not yet .\" On her way home she usually bought a slice of honey-cake at the baker's. It was her Sunday treat. Sometimes there was an almond in her slice, sometimes not. It made a great difference. If there was an almond it was like carrying home a tiny present\u2014a surprise\u2014 something that might very well not have been there. She hurried on the almond Sundays and struck the match for the kettle in quite a dashing way. But today she passed the baker's by, climbed the stairs, went into the little dark room\u2014her room like a cupboard\u2014and sat down on the red eiderdown. She sat there for a long time. The box that the fur came out of was on the bed. She unclasped the necklet quickly; quickly, without looking, laid it inside. But when she put the lid on she thought she heard something crying. ## Plot Summary Miss Brill is an English teacher living near the Public Gardens in a French town. The narrative follows her on a regular Sunday afternoon, which she spends walking about and sitting in the park. The story opens with Miss Brill delighting in her decision to wear her fur. She notices that there are more park-goers than there were last Sunday, and that the band is more enthusiastic because the Season has commenced. Miss Brill observes facets of the lives around her, \"listening as though she didn't listen, ...sitting in other people's lives just for a minute while they talked round her\". She sees the world as a play: as though her surroundings are a set and she and her fellow park-goers actors. She imagines that the band's performance corresponds with and highlights the park's happenings. When the band strikes up a new song, Miss Brill envisions everyone in the park taking part in the song and singing. She begins to cry at the thought. A young couple arrive and share Miss Brill's bench. Miss Brill believes they are nicely dressed and warmly pictures them as the \"hero and heroine\" of the play. However, she overhears the boy make a rude remark about Miss Brill being a \"stupid old thing\", and the girl agrees, \"It's her fu-fur which is so funny.\" On a typical Sunday, Miss Brill would stop by the bakery, but on this particular day, she goes straight home to a dark room. As she returns her fur to its box, Miss Brill \"[thinks] she [hears] something crying\".
